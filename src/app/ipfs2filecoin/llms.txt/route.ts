If you are an agent asked to perform a migration, read the runbook first: it is
the complete procedure, and the rest of these links are background.

## Do the migration

- [Migration runbook](${BASE_URL}${RUNBOOK_PATH}): the executable procedure — prerequisites, ordered command sequence, stop conditions, and failure modes. Start here.
- [ipfs2foc](${CLI_REPO_URL}): the CLI the runbook drives, with the full command reference and troubleshooting.

## Background

- [IPFS to Filecoin](${BASE_URL}${PATHS.IPFS_TO_FILECOIN.path}): what this is, what it costs, and what it does not do. Includes a free in-browser CID check.
- [Warm storage service](${BASE_URL}${PATHS.WARM_STORAGE_SERVICE.path}): the storage product underneath, and its pricing.
- [Documentation](${FOC_URLS.documentation.home}): Filecoin Onchain Cloud docs.

## Limits

- [Talk to our team](${BASE_URL}${PATHS.CONTACT.path}): for sources that are not reachable from a public gateway, or to agree capacity and timing before a large run. There is no cap on how many CIDs the agent or CLI path can migrate; individual items above ${MAX_ITEM_SIZE_LABEL} cannot be migrated, because splitting them would change their CID.
